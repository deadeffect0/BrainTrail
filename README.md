    - To add a new relative, type `1`.
    - To start recognition, type `2`.
    - To exit the program, type `3`.

4. If you choose option `1` to add a new relative:
    - Enter the name, address, relationship, and gender of the relative when prompted.
    - Upload images of the relative as instructed.
    - The script will generate embeddings and update the face detector.

5. If you choose option `2` to start recognition:
    - Choose the mode by typing `1` for voice mode or `2` for text mode.
    - If you choose voice mode, the script will activate voice recognition.
    - If you choose text mode, the script will activate text recognition.

6. If you choose option `3`, the program will exit.

7. If you input an invalid choice, the program will display "Invalid Choice" and prompt you again.
